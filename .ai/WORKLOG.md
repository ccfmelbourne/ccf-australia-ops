# Engineering Worklog

## Purpose
Capture key decisions, progress, and open items for the repository foundation.

## Sections
- `Notes` — working context and discoveries.
- `Decisions` — approved repository-level decisions.
- `Open items` — TODO items and unresolved decisions.

## Notes
- Foundation phase only; no application code.
- Documentation should be brief and cross-referenced.

## Decisions
- Repository structure includes `.ai`, `docs/`, `adr/`, `specs/`, and `.github/`.
- AI guidance and project charter are stored under `.ai/`.
- README functions as a navigation hub with links to core docs.
- ADR 0001: the reimbursement application (not email/PDF) is the system of record for
  reimbursements and their approval history; email is a notification channel only. See
  `adr/0001-reimbursement-system-of-record.md`.
- Spec 0001: V1 scope boundary for the reimbursement request → approval → Finance queue
  workflow, explicitly excluding Xero/bank integration for V1. See
  `specs/0001-reimbursement-approval-finance-workflow.md`. Confirmed with Finance/leadership on
  2026-08-27, including Finance statuses, the Needs Clarification vs. re-approval distinction,
  email as primary notification channel, and a Regional Director/COS-override rule for >$5,000
  requests (Ross Callado, Joel Jerez, Vamie Pinlac can unanimously override Regional Director
  approval, but only if the request is within budget).
- ADR 0002: platform architecture is a modular monolith on Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind,
  Storybook, Zod, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, with domain-scoped internal modules (Finance first).
  See `adr/0002-platform-architecture.md`. Status: Proposed — not yet reviewed by the full
  engineering team; object storage provider and platform hosting target are still open.
- `.github/` governance scaffolding added: PR template, a domain-proposal issue template, and a
  bug-report issue template. No CI workflow yet — no application code exists on `main` to test.
- `docs/product/README.md` and `docs/development/README.md` filled in with real content
  (Finance domain V1 summary; stack, branching, commit, and testing conventions).

## Open items
- TODO: Add an Actions CI workflow once Track B has application code to test on `main`.
- TODO: Get ADR 0002 (platform architecture) reviewed and marked Accepted by the engineering
  team; resolve its open questions (object storage provider, hosting target).
- TODO: Decide whether to bring the confirmed Regional Director/COS-override rule into the live
  Track A pilot during its remaining test window, or leave the pilot's existing (Oceana-only)
  rule as-is until Track B is built.
